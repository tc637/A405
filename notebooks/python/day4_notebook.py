# #  Entropy problem
# 
# Consider two compartments, each with a volume of 1 $m^3$, separated by a rigid, perfectly insulating membrane.
# 
# Initially T_A = 300 K and p_A = $10^5$ Pa, and T_B= 100 K and p_B = 10^3 Pa.  Suppose the membrane breaks.  Find the final temperature and pressure in the 2 m^3 compartment.   Does the total entropy change?  By how much?
